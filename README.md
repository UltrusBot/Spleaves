# Spleaves
Re-implements the spleaves from the 2023 April Fools Update, and adds some new features to them!

Here is a small gif of the spleaves in action:

There are two types of spleaves:
- Regular Spleaves, which break when walked on, with more oxidized ones taking longer to break.
- Reinforced Spleaves, which don't break when walked on, and are great for decoration.

Recipes can be viewed in the recipe book, or with a recipe viewer mod like EMI.
